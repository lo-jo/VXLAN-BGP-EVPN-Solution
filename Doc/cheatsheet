## What is an autonomous system ?

The internet is a network made up of multiple smaller networks called autonomous systems.

These networks are essentially a large pool of routers run by a single organization.  Every computer or device connected to the internet is linked to an AS. 

Each AS have a coherent routing policy which means that they dispacth specific ip ranges that they control and define which other AS they interact with.

Autonomous systems pass this information on internet using the BGP protocol (Border Gateway Protocol).

## What is the BGP Protocol
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the routing protocol for the Internet. Much like the post office processing mail, BGP picks the most efficient routes for delivering Internet traffic amongst autonomous systems.

## What is VLAN
A Virtual local area network groups devices regardless of their physical emplacement.

They are used to create independent networks inside a physical network. 

A physical network is like a tower building where VLAN are floors and communication rules (switches) are elevators or doors that let or forbid the apartments communicate with each other.


## What is VXLAN
VLAN have their limits especially in big data centers and cloud environments.

##### VLANs have a limited number
VLANs work under OSI model layer 2 unfortunately the IEEE 802.1Q norm restricts the number of possible VLAN to 4096 because of the 12 bits marking of VLANs.

VxLAN, on the other hand, have a VNI coded under 24 bits which equals up to 16 millions of VXLANs inside the same domain.

#Basic functioning of gns3

Gns 3 is an open source network simulation tool. It is used to elaborate/simulate more or less complex network typologies by emulating physical means such as routers/switches/hosts.

Gns3 is composed of 

- A GUI that permits us to design the topologies, configure the devices, link them etc...

- A "back-end" component that manages the devices. This server can be located on our machine or on a remote server.

Emulation of devices can be set up in several "cost-effective" ways (QEMU, virtualization or Docker containers as in this project). Devices like Cisco or other third parties hardware can also be emulated.

The network topologies will be built/exported as projects that will carry through all the configuration that has been made. On the opening of such a project we can launch all the devices 
and get control of them by using their internal consoles. Topologies's complexity is only limited by the ressources of our host machine.

You can also use third parties utilities (as Wireshark) to capture packet traffic and troubleshoot your topologies.

#Differences between layer 2 and layer 3

Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) and Layer 3 (Network Layer) are two layers of the OSI model and have different purposes.

- Layer 2 :

It manages local communication between devices that are physically connected on the same network segment and ensure reliable communication between directly connected devices.
It also defines how data is formatted and provide mechanisms for devices on the same network to identify each other using MAC adresses. Mac adresses are hardware-based and unique to each
network interface cards. 
Typical devices concerned by layer 2 are the switches (forwarding data based on mac address within a network segment) and bridges (connect and filter traffic between two or more segments).
Typical protocols used by layer 2 are Ethernet (data framing and Mac addressing over wired network), WIFI (almost same but wireless) and ARP (technically a layer 3 protocol but operates at 
layer 2 to map IP adresses to MAC addresses).
The data unit used at layer 2 is a frame. It includes a header (containing the MAC address), a payload (data) and an error-checking mechanism.
Operations are limited to local network or broadcast domain (a frame can be sent to all devices on the same local network). Data at layer 2 cannot traverse routers.

- Layer 3 :

It manages end-to-end communication across different networks enabling data to travel to travel between devices located on different network segments.
It handles logical adressing (by the mean of IP adress) and routing (determining the best path from source to destination through different routers). It also ensures that packets are delivered
to the correct destination.
Typical devices concerned by layer 3 are the routers (forwarding data between different routers based on IP adress and determining the best path between networks) and some layer 3 switches.
Typical protocols used by layer 3 are IP (logical adressing), ICMP (diagnostic purposes like ping) and routing protocols (OSPF, BGP that determines the best routes for traffic)
The data unit used at layer 3 is a packet. It contains a header(source and destination IP address), a payload (data) and control information for routing and framgentation. In case of fragmentation 
of the data, the receiving device is responsible for re-assembly of the data.
Operations at layer 3 can occur through different network and across the Internet. Broadcasting between different network is limited but multicast can be used at layer 3 (send data to groups of devices).

#Packet routing Software

We used zebra that is an open source software. Zebra permit us to manage network protocol routing tables (data structure used by routers to store path to different destination) and handles multiple protocols.
We can adjust it to our need easily through configuration file, as zebra uses separate protocol specific daemons. It also allows different protocols to interact and share informations about network routes.

#What is BGPD service requested in the subject

It is the BGP daemon that is used by our packet routing software to implement the Border Gateway Protocol within our networks. It usually runs on routers or servers and enables them to exchange 
network reachability informations.

#What is OSFPD service requested in the subject

It is the OSPF daemon. OSPF is an interior gateway protocol used for routing within a sing AS. It builds a complete map of the network topology and uses Djiksta algorithm to find the shorest path to each destination.
OSPF maintains and updates the routing table according to topology changes. 
Devices can be "grouped" inside areas to reduce the complexity of larhe routing tables. Devices of a same area exchanges summarized routing informations to reduce the amount of detailed informations that needs to 
be stored and processed.

#What is Routing engine service service requested in the subject

It is IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System). As OSPF it is also a link-state IGP protocol that uses Djikstra's algorithm to determine the best route for traffic. 
As opposed to OSPF (that operates at layer 3), IS-IS operates on top of layer 2.

#What is Busybox service requested in the subject

Busybox is a service that include many system tools (ls, ps, grep for example) packaged in a single executable file. Busybox is often used in embedded systems or devices such as routers
because of it's lightweight size compared to the GNU coreutils package.

#What is VXLAN and differences with a VLAN


#What is a switch

A switch is a hardware device that connectis multiple devices within a network and allows them to communicate by forwarding data. It operates mainly at layer 2 of the OSI model.
It receives data and forward to other devices based on their MAC addresses (it builds a table of MAC addresses of each device that is connected to one of it's port).

#What is a bridge

Bridge is almost the same as a switch but is an older techonology device. It can connect fewer network segements and have less ports thant most of modern switches.
They can still be used in small network configurations.
We might also consider software bridges upon a device such as a router. The software bridge will permit us to link multiple interfaces ( physical and software as VXLAN interaces)
upon the same device.


#Differences between broadcast and multicast

They are two different methods of sending data over a network. They both handles sending data to multiple devices but in different ways.

With broadcast, the data is sent to all the devices over a network by using the broadcast address. It operates at layer 2 essentially. 
It is used for tasks like ARP. It is typically limited to a local network as routers usually block broadcasts from propagating.

With multicast, data is sent to all the devices that belong to a specific group. It is more efficient as only the concerned devices will receive the data.
It operates mostly at layer 3. Multicast can be routed across different networks and so groups can span multiple segments. 

#Expected operation of the topology in p2

We have two routers that are connected by a switch that acts as a layer 2 device, permitting  the two routers to communicate based on their mac adress.
We also have two hosts that are respectively connected to each router.
We must setup a VXLAN tunnel between our two routers to enable communication between the two hosts as if they were on the same local network without using IP routing at layer 3.
The purpose of this VXLAN tunnel is to create an overlay network (layer 2) on top of a layer 3 network.
On each router we will add a Vxlan interface that will be on the same VNI and we will use two forwarding methods.

First we will use static unicast forwarding. The tunnel will be created between the two routers. On each router we will explicitely define
the other remote router/endpoint (VTEP) address. In this mode, the traffic will be encapsulated by the router and sent only to the other endpoint (point to point communication).

The second mode we will use is multicast forwarding. In this mode we define a multicast group and add routers to this group by giving them a multicast group adress.
This way, traffic (as broadcast frames or ARP requests) is dispatched to all the routers that have joined the same multicast group.

The traffic should then occurs as so (in the case of host 1 trying to reach host 2) :

Host 1 will prepare an Ethernet frame containing IP and MAC address of host 2 (mac obtained via ARP request if unknown at that stage).
Router 1 will encapsulate this into a VXLAN packet and transmit it to the other VTEP that is router 2.
