## What is an autonomous system ?

The internet is a network made up of multiple smaller networks called autonomous systems.

These networks are essentially a large pool of routers run by a single organization.  Every computer or device connected to the internet is linked to an AS. 

Each AS have a coherent routing policy which means that they dispacth specific ip ranges that they control and define which other AS they interact with.

Autonomous systems pass this information on internet using the BGP protocol (Border Gateway Protocol).

## What is the BGP Protocol
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the routing protocol for the Internet. Much like the post office processing mail, BGP picks the most efficient routes for delivering Internet traffic amongst autonomous systems.

## What is VLAN
A Virtual local area network groups devices regardless of their physical emplacement.

They are used to create independent networks inside a physical network. 

A physical network is like a tower building where VLAN are floors and communication rules (switches) are elevators or doors that let or forbid the apartments communicate with each other.


##### VLANs have a limited number
VLANs work under OSI model layer 2 unfortunately the IEEE 802.1Q norm restricts the number of possible VLAN to 4096 because of the 12 bits marking of VLANs.

VxLAN, on the other hand, have a VNI coded under 24 bits which equals up to 16 millions of VXLANs inside the same domain.

## What is VXLAN

[VXLAN](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7348) or Virtual Extensible Local Area Network is a network virtualization technology that allows the creation of virtual layer 2 network on top of layer 3 (IP).
It uses encapsulation to carry Ethernet Frames over an IP Network, enabling scalability in large data centers by extending VLAN limit and supporting multi-tenant environments.

Server virtualization increases demands on physical networks, as multiple VMs with unique MAC addresses require larger MAC tables. VLAN limits (4094) are inadequate for scaling, and multiple tenants may cause MAC and VLAN ID conflicts. Layer 2 networks need to scale efficiently across data centers, but traditional protocols like STP waste links. To solve this, VXLAN creates an overlay network, encapsulating VM traffic over logical tunnels, allowing scalable and efficient Layer 2 connectivity across large environments.
