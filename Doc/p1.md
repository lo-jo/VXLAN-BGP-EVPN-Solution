# Part 1 : GNS3 configuration with Docker
Configure GNS3 and Docker to create a Host and a Router from docker images.

[<img src="topology_p1.png" width="500"/>](Topology1)

# Requirements 
Install gns3 with the installation script:

``` 
/vagrant/installgns3.sh 
```

Build the docker IMAGES host-mflores and router-mflores with:
```
./build_images
```

Check that all daemons are running 


# Router configuration
### Project constraints
#### A software that manages packet routing (zebra or quagga)
FRRouting was installed from a Docker image.
Free Range Routing is a network routing software that was created as a fork from Quagga.

Starting FRR will do nothing without explicitely enabling it by editing the daemons configuration file located at ``` /etc/frr/daemons ```.
From there it is possible to determine wich daemons are activated. 

```
bgpd=yes
ospfd=yes
ospf6d=no
ripd=no
ripngd=no
isisd=yes
pimd=no
pim6d=no
ldpd=no
nhrpd=no
eigrpd=no
babeld=no
sharpd=no
pbrd=no
bfdd=no
fabricd=no
vrrpd=no
pathd=no

```

#### The BGPD service must be enabled
In the context of network routing configuration, the BGPD service handles the routing decisions made by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

BGP is the protocol used to exchange routing information between different networks, known as autonomous systems (AS), on the internet. It is crucial for determining the most efficient routes for data to travel between these networks.

The BGPD service plays a critical role in enabling inter-AS routing, allowing different networks across the globe to communicate and route data efficiently.
It is used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), large enterprises, and data centers to manage internet routing and ensure that traffic flows across the most optimal paths.

#### The OSFPD service must be active
The OSPFD service refers to the OSPF daemon (OSPFD), which is responsible for implementing and managing the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol in a network routing system. OSPF is a widely used interior gateway protocol (IGP) that helps routers dynamically exchange routing information within the same autonomous system (AS) or network.

Unlike BGP, which is used for routing between different autonomous systems, OSPF is used to manage routing within a single AS.

#### There must be an IS-IS routing engine service
IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) is a dynamic link-state routing protocol designed to move information efficiently within a computer network, particularly for intra-domain (or intra-AS) routing. 

Like OSPF, IS-IS is used by routers within an autonomous system (AS) to determine the best path for data.
