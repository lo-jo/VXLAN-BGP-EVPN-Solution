# BGP with EPVN

BGP EVPN (Ethernet VPN) over VXLAN setup with:
- one router acting as a RR (route reflector)
- three routers for VXLAN (VTEPs-VXLAN tunnel endpoints)
- three hosts connected to the routers 

# Network components
### The Route Reflector 
The Route Reflector's role is to facilitate the distribution of BGP EVPN routes betweens the VTEPs.
Without the RR, the tunnels would need to peer with each other in a full-mesh internal BGP config (A full mesh iBGP peering is required within an AS because iBGP routers do not re-advertise routes learned via iBGP to other iBGP peers. ).
In large topologies such as data centers, this is a problem because full mesh peering is not very scalable.

### VXLAN Routers (vxlan tunnel enpoints)
Just like they did in p2, these routers serve as the vxlan tunnel enpoints in this topology. They encapsulate layer 2 ethernet frames in VXLAN headers to transport traffic accross layer 3.
Each tunnel learns MAC and IP addresses from the hosts connected to them and exchancges information with other endpoints via BGP EVPN.

### Hosts
End devices connected to the network placed in different segments over VLANs.

# BGP EVPN - Controller
BGP EVPN acts as a controller by distributing MAC and IP address info across the endpoints.
VTEPs thus learn how to reach the remote MAC addresses associated with Virtual Network Identifiers. 

The RR simplifies BGP EVPN operations by reflecting routes.
